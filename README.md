# Customer-Retention-Churn-Analysis-for-a-Subscription-Based-SaaS-Product
This project analyzes customer churn for a fictional subscription-based telecom/SaaS company using structured data from Maven Analytics. The objective was to understand churn behavior, identify high-risk customer segments, and recommend strategies to improve retention and lifetime value.

**Business Questions**

•What is the overall customer churn rate?

•Which customer segments are most likely to churn?

•How does churn vary by:

·Contract type

·Customer tenure

·Number of active services

•What actions can the business take to reduce churn?

**Tools & Skills**

•SQL: data exploration, churn definition, aggregations, segmentation

•Power BI: KPI tracking, interactive dashboards, data storytelling

•Business Analytics: churn analysis, customer segmentation, retention strategy,

**Analysis Approach**

•Defined churn based on customer status (churned vs active)

•Calculated overall churn rate

•Analyzed churn across:
·Contract types (month-to-month vs annual)
·Tenure buckets
·Number of active services

•Built an end-to-end Power BI dashboard to communicate insights clearly

**Key Insights**

•Month-to-month customers have significantly higher churn compared to annual contract customers

•Churn is most concentrated in the first 6 months, suggesting gaps in onboarding and early value delivery

•Customers with multiple active services churn far less, indicating a strong link between product adoption and retention

**Recommendations**

•Incentivize customers to switch from month-to-month to annual contracts

•Improve onboarding and early engagement for new customers

•Promote bundled services to increase adoption and reduce churn risk

**What This Project Demonstrates**

•Ability to translate raw data into meaningful business insights

•Strong understanding of churn and retention dynamics

•End-to-end analytics workflow: SQL → Power BI → Recommendations

•Clear communication of insights for both technical and non-technical audiences
